#Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many weeks we have left, if we live until 90 years old.
#It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:
#You have x weeks left
#age = input()
age = 15
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

#MY_SOLUTION
weeks_in_year = 52
weeks_in_ninety_years = 52 * 90
print(weeks_in_ninety_years)

weeks_left = int(age) * weeks_in_ninety_years

print(f"you have {weeks_left} weeks left")


#ANGELA_SOLUTION
age = input()
# Your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
years = 90 - int(age)
weeks = years * 52

print(f"You have {weeks} weeks left.")
